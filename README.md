Homework Assignment 3 for Software Engineering II


CS 4311 – Spring 2018 – hw3

due: May 11, 2018, end of day

This is a loosely-constrained assignment to give you more experience with the Observer pattern and the Model-View-Controller architecture. You may do this assignment as either an individual assignment of a group assignment. See below for details on group requirements.

1.     Take an old project you have done for another class that does not have a GUI and modify it so that it supports a GUI.

·       Since there’s a good chance I have no idea what your project does, do document what its supposed to do and how to use it

·       You may use AWT/Swing, JavaFX or the Android framework. Pick something that everyone in the group can comfortably work with.

·       The code must separate the GUI views/controllers from the domain logic and data (the model)

2.     Group requirements:

·       2-3 members

·       Pick a team leader – of course you want everyone’s input, and this is not so everyone can just work on the leader’s pet project. The point is so that when it’s hard to make a decision (like what program to modify), someone can take charge and make the final decision.

·       Create a project site on github.com or some other comparable site. Give me the URL so I can check on the activity.

·       Upload the existing project as the starting point for your work

·       Do not submit work too late for others to adapt to it

1.     You should have some meaningful contribution up on the project site by May 9, preferably earlier

·       Make sure you have enough for everyone to do. People will need some time to understand the existing code, and it may be necessary to revise non-GUI code.

1.     As a highly imperfect measure, if each person is contributing 100 lines of code, that should be plenty.

2.     Note that this should include part of the main program code, but may include testing code as well

Submission: Individuals need to submit to Blackboard. For groups, submit your project URL. Whatever is on your repository by the deadline will be the submission.

Grading: For group members, there will be a penalty if you wait too long to upload stuff. Otherwise, 80% Correctness (does require proper separation of View/Controller from Model), 20% style

Style: I still want to see comments for each class and method (including for testing code). You still need to use good identifier names and name the constants you use.
